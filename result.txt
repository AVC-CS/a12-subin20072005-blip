=== MEMORY SEGMENT BOUNDARIES ===

--- TEXT SEGMENT (Code) ---
Address of main():       0x5ddbcdc53397
Address of checkStack(): 0x5ddbcdc53209

--- DATA SEGMENT (Initialized Globals) ---
initializedGlobal1: 0x5ddbcdc56010 value: 100
initializedGlobal2: 0x5ddbcdc56014 value: 200

--- BSS SEGMENT (Uninitialized Globals) ---
uninitializedGlobal1: 0x5ddbcdc56154 value: 0
uninitializedGlobal2: 0x5ddbcdc56158 value: 0

--- STACK SEGMENT (Cross-function comparison) ---
Value of parentAddr: 0x7ffdbfd9a7a4
Address of parentAddr parameter: 0x7ffdbfd9a778
Address of childVar local variable: 0x7ffdbfd9a784
Stack grows: DOWN

--- HEAP SEGMENT (Dynamic Allocation) ---
heap1 address: 0x5ddbdf23b2b0
heap2 address: 0x5ddbdf23b6c0
Heap grows: UP

=== RELATIVE POSITION SUMMARY ===
Compare TEXT, DATA, BSS, HEAP, STACK addresses above.
Typically: TEXT < DATA < BSS < HEAP < STACK
